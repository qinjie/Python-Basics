    "#### Simple\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a simple and minimalistic language. Reading a good Python program feels almost like reading English.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Easy to Learn\n",
    "Python is a High-level Language with extraordinarily simple syntax which is extremely easy to get started with.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Free and Open Source\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Portable\n",
    "Due to its open-source nature, Python has been ported to many platforms. Python programs can work on any of these platforms without requiring any changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreted\n",
    "Python code does not need compilation to binary before it runs. Python program runs directly from the source code. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Object Oriented\n",
    "Python supports procedure-oriented programming as well as object-oriented programming. In <b> procedure-oriented </b> languages, the program is built around procedures or functions which are nothing but reusable pieces of programs. In <b> object-oriented </b> languages, the program is built around objects which combine data and functionality.\n",
